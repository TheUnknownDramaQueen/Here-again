          Bathroom Blunder: The Smelly Truth About G.M 08
            </p>
            <p>
                 Spotted: G.M 08 went to the bathroom and, let’s just say, it smelled not so fresh.
               Guess she had an accident after finding out that people think she’s “clingy and toxic.” because her boyfriend is saying that.Ouch.

            <p>
      Spotted: Veneta 08 pretending to be all innocent, but let’s not forget, she lost her innocence back in 7th grade.
      Oh, and did we mention she was a little hooked on something back then too? The past always catches up.

          Love, Lies, and Heartbreak: A Story of Rejection
            </p>
            <p>
      Spotted: Ruslana 08, totally head over heels for Petko 08, but turns out, he’s still hung up on Eleonora from his class.
      Oh, and did we mention Eleonora is the ex of his best friend? Sharing is caring, right? But this wasn’t the first time for Petko.
      Love’s a tricky game. Petko blocked Ruslana, and when she tried calling him, he shut her down with a cold “I don’t want you.” Ouch, Ruslana—replaced by Elito. How sad.

            <p>
      Spotted: Michelle ’07 had her sights set on Madlen ’08 PG, but things didn’t go as planned – turns out Madlen is still stuck on her ex. Yikes.
      Meanwhile, Michelle hasn’t moved on from her ex either… At first glance, Michelle doesn’t seem to show any interest… The only question is – before which girl or boy? Oh, and someone’s been stalking her and definitely has a thing for her.

          The Divalicious Drama Queens Are Back
            </p>
            <p>
      Spotted: The infamous four—Presiana, Iveta, Michelle, and Teodora—are at it again.
      We all know these ladies don’t just love drama; they create it. Scandal is their middle name,
      and they never miss a chance to stir things up. Whether it’s chasing their own interests or just causing chaos for fun,
      one thing’s for sure—today won’t be any different. The teachers call them divas, but we all know they wear that title like a crown.
      Stay tuned, because where they go, trouble always follows.

            <p>
      Spotted: Gabriela ‘09, deep in conversation with Preslav Bochukov ‘08—but that’s not stopping her from keeping a little too close to the boyfriends of her mutuals.
                Coincidence? I think not. Playing both sides is a dangerous game, and sooner or later, someone’s bound to notice. Stay tuned—this one’s getting interesting.

          Betrayal, Secrets, and Scandal: The Truth Behind the Love Triangle
            </p>
            <p>
      Spotted: Finito 010 once Mitko 08’s lover, now with his biggest enemy, Valyo Vikinga. 
      Why? Maybe because he was the one who helped her home while she was still with Mitko. 
      Ouch.And Renito 09? The so-called bestie—now dating Finito’s ex. 
      Loyalty? Never heard of her. They were enemies, talking behind each other’s backs, and now? 
      Same old tricks, just new alliances.
      Today, Mitko’s girl and his ex—aka Renito & Finito—caught gossiping again. About Gabriela 09? Wouldn’t be the first time. But is Mitko okay with this? Something tells me the drama’s just getting started.

         Spotted: Elito 010 itching for a showdown with Raya Dimova 08. 
         Word is, tensions have escalated, and Elito’s ready to throw down. 
         What’s fueling this feud? A love triangle gone wrong? 
         A betrayal that cuts deep? Or just a classic case of too much drama and not enough sense?

            You think your family loves you, think again
            </p>
            <p>
           Spotted: Maxim, caught in a family feud fit for a soap opera.
           M thinks his mother is watching his every move—literally. Cameras, suspicion, paranoia. Can’t even have a little me time without feeling like Big Brother (or should we say, Big Mother?) is watching. And his dad? Well, let’s just say fatherly love isn’t exactly in the air.
           Is it all in M’s head, or is there something darker at play? Either way, between the surveillance state at home and an enemy in disguise (looking at you, Q), poor Maxim has nowhere to run.
           Hang in there, M. And maybe check for hidden cameras.

            Max 09 messing up, again
            </p>
            <p>
           Spotted: Our dear Maxim, mistaking a wolf in sheep’s clothing for a kindred spirit. How tragic. How naïve.
           Word on the street? M thought he was gaining a new bestie, a confidant, a fellow rainbow warrior. But oh, darling, the only thing Q is waving is a red flag. Because the truth? Q isn’t here for friendship—he’s here for vengeance. And Maxim? He’s the target.
           Was it a misunderstanding? A cruel twist of fate? Or did Q want Maxim to feel safe before he struck? Either way, the game is on, and poor Maxim is playing checkers while Q is orchestrating chess.
           Keep your friends close, M. And your enemies? Even closer.

            </p>
            <p>
            Spotted: Max 09 crushing on Martin 08—but only for two days. 
            Before that? He was with Ema 09’s boyfriend (or ex)… but before Eva. 
            And the plot thickens—back in 8th grade, Eva 09 had a thing for Plamena. 
            Now, Max and Eva just dropped a story that’s… well, not so normal.

            What’s really going on here? Stay tuned, darlings—the gay drama is just getting started.

               Elito 010’s Wild Ride: Love, Drama & a Scandalous Video
            </p>
            <p>
             Spotted: Elito 010 in a very revealing video—three guys, one car, and zero shame.
            But the real drama? First, she crushed on Martin 08, then moved on to Panayot 08—only for things to crash and burn over her questionable hangouts with gypsies.
            And now? She’s officially done with Panayot.
             Messy doesn’t even begin to cover it.
